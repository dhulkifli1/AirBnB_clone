# AirBnB_clone

## Project Description
The goal of the project is to deploy on my server a simple copy of the AirBnB website.
Not all features will be implemented, only some of them to cover all fundamental concepts of the higher level programming track.
After 4 months, I will have a complete web application composed by:
  - A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell (perfect for development and debugging)
  - A website (the front-end) that shows the final product to everybody: static and dynamic
  - A database or files that store data (data = objects)
  - An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and your data (retrieve, create, delete, update them)

## Command interpreter description
A Command Interpreter is exactly the same as the Shell, with the only difference being that an interpreter is limited to a specific use-case.
In this case, it is necessary to be able to manage the objects of the project:
  - Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
  - Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
  - Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
  - Update attributes of an object
  - Destroy an object
